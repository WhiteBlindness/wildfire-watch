                "Sampling: the map shows up to 15,000 detections. Every detection in Portugal is kept; elsewhere, the highest radiative power and an even geographic spread take priority. Totals refer to this sample, not to every detection worldwide.",
                "Fire radiative power (FRP): measured by the satellite in megawatts. The map groups it into four intensity classes (below 10, 10 to 49, 50 to 149, and 150 MW or more) used only for colour. It is not a measure of how severe a fire is.",
                "Confidence: the category (low, nominal or high) that NASA assigns to each detection.",
                "Burned area: an order-of-magnitude estimate from radiative power and the time since the first detection. It assumes 0.368 kg of biomass burned per MJ of radiated energy (Wooster et al., 2005) and about 3.8 kg/m² of fuel consumed, typical of shrubland and forest. It is not an observed area.",
                "Official occurrences: ANEPC's public list of open occurrences, for mainland Portugal only. WildfireWatch shows rural fires only (nature codes 31xx), leaving out burns, fuel management and mop-up consolidation, and does not keep the occurrence's address.",
                "Linking the sources: a satellite detection is linked to an official occurrence when it lies within 5 km of the registered location and was acquired no more than 6 hours before the occurrence started. If two occurrences are at similar distances (within 1 km of each other), the detection is linked to neither. The rules are fixed and public, and the same data always gives the same result. Both sources keep their own records: linking only relates them.",
